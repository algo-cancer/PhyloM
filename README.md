# System configs
All the experiments in this work are performed using **Carbonate**, a computer cluster at Indiana University. We used deep learning (DL) nodes in Carbonate.
These nodes features 12 GPU-accelerated Lenovo ThinkSystem SD530 , each equipped with two Intel Xeon Gold 6126 12-core CPUs, two NVIDIA GPU accelerators (eight with Tesla P100s; four with Tesla V100s), and 192 GB of RAM. A Red Hat Enterprise 7.x is running on these nodes and we used **Python 3.7.3** :: Anaconda, Inc., **Tensorflow 1.13.1**, and **Keras 2.2.4**.
